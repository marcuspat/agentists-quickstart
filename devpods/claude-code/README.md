## 🚀 Complete Prompting Guide - Maximize Your Agent Hivemind

### The Master Pattern
Always include this in your prompts to maximize agent effectiveness:
```
"Identify all of the subagents that could be useful in any way for this task and then figure out how to utilize the claude-flow hivemind to maximize your ability to accomplish the task."
```

### Essential Prompting Examples

#### Example 1: Full Project Development with Visualizations
```
"I need to build a REST API for a todo application. Look in /workspaces/agentists-quickstart/agents/ and:
1. Identify all subagents that could be useful for this task
2. Create a complete development plan with visualizations
3. Break down the plans into many SVG visualizations that are simple and explainable
4. Figure out how to utilize the claude-flow hivemind to maximize our ability to accomplish this
5. Chain the appropriate agents together for planning, implementation, testing, and deployment
6. Create visualizations of what I would build first
7. Make sure visualizations are extremely explainable and understandable by a human being"
```

#### Example 2: Complex Analysis with Visual Breakdowns
```
"Analyze this codebase and create visualizations of what I would build first. 
- Break down all plans into many many visualizations that would be useful to someone about to develop this project
- Make sure it's done in simple SVG so it's extremely explainable and understandable by a human being
- That is your ultimate goal
- Identify all subagents that could be useful in any way for this task
- Figure out how to utilize the claude-flow hivemind to maximize your ability to accomplish the task"
```

#### Example 3: Business and Life Enhancement (500+ Non-Coding Agents)
```
"I want to improve my startup's development workflow. There are agents to help with all aspects of your business and life. 500+ Non Coding Agents. Claude Code has access to the internet and any MCP tools you give it. Simply tell it what you want and then tell it to:
- Identify all subagents that could be useful for workflow optimization
- Create visual diagrams of the current vs improved workflow
- Utilize the claude-flow hivemind to create a comprehensive improvement plan
- Include agents for project management, team coordination, and productivity"
```

#### Example 4: Infrastructure Research & Implementation
```
"Draft detailed research into using rackspace spot H100-enabled servers to spawn a self hosted LLM service on rackspace spot compute platform using kubernetes. Put the output into research/rackspace folder. Draw information from youtube transcripts (tools/youtube-transcript-api), github repos, blog posts, and any web-accessible source. Draft detailed instructions to create the kubernetes manifests to serve the likes of qwen3 coder, kimi k2, and other state of the art models. Remember the current date is August 7, 2025. Spawn 5 agents to work on this process concurrently. Use the available MCP servers to conduct this research. Keep iterating until a clear path to implementation exists. Include cost analysis on a per 1 million token basis based on a H100 bid price of $0.71/hr."
```

#### Example 5: Creative Animation Project with Visual Verification
```
"Create a folder in /front-end-demo/ create a detailed animation using anime.js highlighting the benefits of pineapple on pizza. Spawn 3 agents to work on this project in parallel. Use the available MCP servers. Install playwright and use playwright to generate screenshots of the created webpage animation using a 400x750px viewport. Create an animation where the pizza spins as the user scrolls down where pineapple slices are added or removed from the pizza as the user scrolls. Keep iterating until the animation is smooth and will reliably work on mobile devices. If stuck, contact deep research using web-accessible sources, github repos, and youtube video transcripts to identify solutions."
```

#### Example 6: Multi-Agent Research Coordination
```
"I need to research Kubernetes LLM serving, cost optimization, and deployment patterns. Current date is August 7, 2025.
- Spawn specialized agents for: Infrastructure (kimi k2), Cost analysis (Triton), GPU optimization ($0.71/hr H100 spot)
- Create parallel deployment strategies using available MCP servers
- Keep iterating until implementation path is clear
- Use web-accessible sources, GitHub repos, and YouTube video transcripts
- Coordinate findings across all agents to identify optimal solutions
- Ask yourself: should I use swarm or hivemind for this task?"
```

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### Recursive Problem Solving with Deep Research
```
"Use recursive thinking to break down this problem. If you get stuck, spawn a research agent to do deep research into:
- YouTube transcripts for tutorials
- GitHub repos for implementation examples  
- Blog posts for best practices
- Analyze existing code for patterns
- Search all web-accessible resources
Keep recursing until you find a working solution. If stuck, do deep research to come up with solutions to try."
```

#### TDD with Goal Achievement and Iteration
```
"Define the end result: A working API with 100% test coverage
Use TDD approach and iterate until goal is achieved:
1. Write failing tests for each endpoint
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Iterate until all acceptance criteria are met
5. Use playwright to take screenshots and verify GUI output is correct
6. If tests fail, do prompt-specific research and try again
7. Keep iterating until goal is achieved
Use CC (Claude Code) for more tasks"
```

#### Visual Verification Loop with Playwright
```
"Build the dashboard component:
1. Create the UI component
2. Install and use playwright for screenshots so the agent can verify the output in the GUI is correct
3. Take a screenshot at 1920x1080 resolution
4. Verify the output matches the design specs
5. If not correct, iterate on the CSS/layout
6. Keep iterating until pixel-perfect
7. Use recursive thinking if stuck
Use CC (Claude Code) for implementing changes"
```

#### Deep Research Pattern
```
"Research the best approach for implementing real-time collaborative editing. Current date is August 7, 2025.
1. Search all web-accessible resources from the last 2 years
2. Analyze YouTube video transcripts for 'collaborative editing implementation'
3. Study GitHub repos using CRDTs or OT algorithms
4. Read blog posts about scaling collaborative apps
5. Analyze code for desired patterns
6. Do research for desired result
7. Feed findings from MCP tools into your analysis
8. Describe the way - multiple implementation paths with pros/cons"
```

#### Folder-Specific Analysis
```
"Only read contents of the /src/components folder and do this:
1. Identify all components that need refactoring
2. Create a prioritized list based on complexity
3. For each component, suggest modern React patterns
4. Don't look at any other folders - focus only on components
You can tell it to only read contents of this folder and do this..."
```

#### Swarm vs Hivemind Decision
```
"I need to process 10,000 customer support tickets. Ask Claude which to use:
- Should I use a swarm pattern (independent agents working on batches)?
- Or hivemind pattern (agents sharing context and learning from each other)?
Analyze the task characteristics and recommend the best approach with reasoning.
Ask yourself: hivemind or swarm?"
```

#### MCP Integration Pattern
```
"Use MCP tools to gather context, then feed MCP into Claude prompts:
1. Use web_search MCP to find latest LLM serving benchmarks
2. Feed search results to the performance-analysis agent
3. Use github MCP to find relevant repos
4. Feed code examples to the implementation agent
5. Coordinate findings across all agents
6. Present unified recommendations
Feed MCP into Claude prompts for enhanced context"
```

#### Goal-Driven Iteration with Fallbacks
```
"End goal: Production-ready authentication system
Current date: August 7, 2025
1. Define end result and success criteria (tests, security, performance)
2. Start with TDD - write comprehensive test suite
3. Implement iteratively until all tests pass
4. If stuck on any test, do deep research:
   - Search for 'authentication best practices 2025'
   - Analyze top auth libraries on GitHub
   - Review security blog posts
   - YouTube transcripts for implementation guides
5. Use playwright to test the login flow visually
6. Iterate until goal - 100% test coverage and visual verification passes
7. If primary approach fails, research alternatives"
```

### Key Prompting Principles

1. **Always specify the current date** - "Remember the current date is August 7, 2025"
2. **Define clear end goals** - "Define the end result" - Agents work better with specific targets
3. **Use iterative refinement** - "Keep iterating until [specific condition]" - "Iterate until goal"
4. **Leverage visual verification** - "Install and use playwright for screenshots" - GUI testing
5. **Combine research and implementation** - "If stuck do deep research" using all sources
6. **Choose the right pattern** - "Ask Claude whether to use swarm or hivemind"
7. **Feed MCP into prompts** - "Feed MCP into Claude prompts" for context
8. **Spawn agents concurrently** - "Spawn 5 agents to work on this process concurrently"
9. **Specify output locations** - "Put the output into research/rackspace folder"
10. **Include fallback strategies** - "If stuck, do deep research to come up with solutions to try"
11. **Use recursive thinking** - Break down problems recursively
12. **Prompt-specific research** - Research tailored to the specific problem
13. **Describe the way** - Have agents explain their approach
14. **Use CC for more tasks** - Leverage Claude Code for implementation
15. **Search all web-accessible resources** - YouTube, GitHub, blogs, etc.

### Advanced Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Parallel Agent Spawning
```
"Spawn 5 agents to work on this process concurrently"
"Spawn 3 agents to work on this project in parallel"
"Spawn specialized agents for different aspects simultaneously"
```

#### Iterative Refinement with Research Triggers
```
"Keep iterating until a clear path to implementation exists"
"Keep iterating until the animation is smooth and will reliably work on mobile devices"
"If stuck, do deep research using YouTube transcripts, GitHub repos, and blog posts"
"Iterate until goal is achieved"
```

#### Resource Utilization
```
"Use the available MCP servers to conduct this research"
"Draw information from youtube transcripts (tools/youtube-transcript-api), github repos, blog posts"
"Search all web-accessible sources from the last 2 years"
"Analyze code for patterns and desired results"
```

### Recursion Examples
```
"Use recursive thinking to solve this problem"
"If you hit a wall, recurse deeper into the sub-problems"
"Break down recursively until you find atomic, solvable units"
"Apply recursive problem-solving to each component"
```

### The Power of Visualization
```
"Break down all of the plans into many many visualizations"
"Create simple SVG visualizations that are extremely explainable"
"Visualizations should be understandable by a human being"
"That is your ultimate goal - human-understandable visualizations"
```
